    "## Why Learn Python? ##\n",
    "Python is an extremely popular programming language with a wide array of uses.  Python is so popular in part because of its simplicity, readability, and flexibility.\n",
    "- Used heavily across web development and data science\n",
    "- Syntax is close to plain english, and isn't as bulky as a strongly typed programming language like Java\n",
    "- Can run on any OS\n",
    "- Extremely large community of users with extensive libraries enabling a wide array of tasks to be executed\n",
    "- High Demand in analytics and software.\n",
    "- Amazing support for data science, AI, and Machine Learning\n",
    "- Abundant resources and documentation make python simple to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases ###\n",
    "- Web Development with Django, Flask, & Pyramid\n",
    "- Data Analytics and Visualization with Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Bokeh, and Dash\n",
    "- ML & AI with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and Pytorch\n",
    "- Scientific Computing with Scipy, Sympy, and Biopython\n",
    "- Automation and scripting for repetitive tasks like file handling, web scraping, and automataion of reports.\n",
    "- Cyber Security Tasks such as network scanning, penetration testing, and security tool creation.\n",
    "- Algorithmic trading, financial modeling, and risk management in FinTech and InsurTech using the extensive libraries available.\n",
